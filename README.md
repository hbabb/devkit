# DevKit 🛠️

My personal code laboratory and learning playground. This repository contains snippets, functions, patterns, and notes from my journey across the programming multiverse.

## What's Inside

This repository is constantly evolving as I learn new languages, frameworks, and techniques. Currently exploring:

- 🌐 **Web Development**: HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript
- 🐍 **Python**: Learning fundamentals and applications
- 🚀 **Coming Soon**: Java, Kotlin, Go, Rust, R, C#, C++, C
- 🐧 **Linux**: Command line wizardry and system administration
- 🔐 **CompTIA**: Working toward certifications

## Organization

Code is organized by language and concept. Each directory contains working snippets, useful functions, and notes on key concepts.

## Learning Resources

Currently leveling up through:

- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) - Real-world projects
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - Interactive courses
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) - Comprehensive video courses

## Why This Exists

This repository serves as both my digital workshop and external brain. It's where I experiment, document what I've learned, and build a toolkit I can leverage for future projects.
